/*Real world example 
Suppose you have a hospital in which patients are attended based on their ages. The oldest are always 
attended first, no matter when he/she got in the queue.

You can't just keep track of the oldest one because if you pull he/she out, you don't know the next 
oldest one. In order to solve this hospital problem, you implement a max heap. This heap is, by 
definition, partially ordered. This means you cannot sort the patients by their age, but you know
that the oldest ones are always in the top, so you can pull a patient out in constant time O(1) 
and re-balance the heap in log time O(log N).

Fibonacciheaps are especially desirable when the number of extract-minimum and delete operations 
is small relative to the number of other operations performed*/

An important part of the Fibonacci Heap is how it marks nodes within the trees. The decrease key
operation marks a node when its child is cut from a tree, this allows it to track some history
about each node. Essentially the marking of nodes allows us to track whether:
Case 1: PTR was a root node.
Case 2: Then PTR was linked to another node.
Case 3: The two children of PTR were removed by the Cut procedure.*/
